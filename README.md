### With factorio 1.1.8 a new UI for trains was added. With that UI a tab with all the train stations was added, so this mod is obsolete now. 

Adds a Train-Station-Overview to search and find station much faster. It keeps track of all stations and can by default beeing opened when pressing [SHIFT + T].
Clicking on a train-station will open it.

Known Issues:
- When removing Train-Stops with creative-mod, they will get removed immediately. This causes to have not all stations listed anymore. This error will fix itself over time. To fix it immediately, click on the "reload"-button in the gui.
